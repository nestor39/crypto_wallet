# Crypto Wallet
> In this project I completed a code that enables customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals.

I created a a new  and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them.  I integrated the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable customers to instantly pay fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency. 

I used two Python files, both of which this repository contains. The first file that I used is called ```fintech_finder.py```, it contains the code associated with the web interface of the application. The code included in this file is compatible with Streamlit library. The second file that I used is called ```crypto_wallet.py```, this file contains the Ethereum transaction functions that I have created throughout this project. By using import statements, I integrated the ```crypto_wallet.py``` Python script into the Fintech Finder interface program that is found in the ```fintech_finder.py``` file. Integrating these two files allows us to automate the tasks associated with generating a digital wallet, accessing Ethereum account balances, and signing and sending transactions via Ethereumâ€™s Kovan testnet.
